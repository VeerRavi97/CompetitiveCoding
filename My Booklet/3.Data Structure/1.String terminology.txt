A substring is a sequence of consecutive characters in a string. We use the
notation s[a...b] to refer to a substring of s that begins at position a and ends
at position b. A string of length n has n(n+1)/2 substrings. For example, the
substrings of ABCD are A, B, C, D, AB, BC, CD, ABC, BCD and ABCD.



A subsequence is a sequence of (not necessarily consecutive) characters in a
string in their original order. A string of length n has (2^n)-1 subsequences. For
example, the subsequences of ABCD are A, B, C, D, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, ABC, ABD,
ACD, BCD and ABCD.



A prefix of a string S is a substring   S' that occurs at the beginning of  S.


A suffix of a string  S is a substring S' that occurs at the end of S.


A rotation can be generated by moving the characters of a string one by one
from the beginning to the end (or vice versa). For example, the rotations of ABCD
are ABCD, BCDA, CDAB and DABC.


A period is a prefix of a string such that the string can be constructed by
repeating the period. The last repetition may be partial and contain only a prefix
of the period. For example, the shortest period of ABCABCA is ABC.


A border is a string that is both a prefix and a suffix of a string. For example,
the borders of ABACABA are A, ABA and ABACABA
   "bab" is a border of "babab" (and also of "babooneatingakebab").


Strings are compared using the lexicographical order (which corresponds
to the alphabetical order).
