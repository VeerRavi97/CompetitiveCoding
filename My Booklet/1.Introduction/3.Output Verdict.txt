Accepted (AC) — Congratulations! Your program is correct, and runs within the
given time and memory limits

Presentation Error (PE) — Your program outputs are correct but are not presented
in the specified format. Check for spaces, left/right justification, line feeds,
etc.

Wrong Answer (WA) — This you should concern you, because your program
returned an incorrect answer to one or more of the judge’s secret test cases. You
have some more debugging to do.


 Compile Error (CE) — you better know this error. The compiler could not figure out how to compile
your program. The resulting compiler messages will be returned to you. Warning
messages that do not interfere with compilation are ignored by the judge.


Runtime Error (RE) — Your program failed during execution due to a segmentation
fault, floating point exception, or similar problem. Its dying message will
be sent back to you. Check for invalid pointer references or division by zero.


Time Limit Exceeded (TL) — Your program took too much time on at least one
of the test cases, so you likely have a problem with efficiency. Just because you
ran out of time on one input does not mean you were correct on all the others,
however!
